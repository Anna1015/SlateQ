# Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation Systems
## A comparison of Google's [SlateQ](https://research.google/pubs/pub48200/) algorithm with traditional Reinforcement Learning techniques for Recommendation Systems

In Google's recent [SlateQ paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/9f91de1fa0ac351ecb12e4062a37afb896aa1463.pdf), they outline a tractable technique to applying Reinforcement Learning to Recommendation Systems. In this repository, we compare their SlateQ algorithm with other techniques via simulation using the [`recsim`](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/recsim-configurable-simulation-platform.html) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/google-research/recsim)) package.

For a high-level overview of the SlateQ algorithm, check out [Craig Boutilier's talk at ICML 2019](https://slideslive.com/38917655/reinforcement-learning-in-recommender-systems-some-challenges).
